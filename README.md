# angular2-express-app-starter
This is a starter repo for an Angular 2, Express, Mongo DB application.

### To run and develop:
1. clone the repo locally
2. `cd` into the 'angular2-express-app-starter' directory
3. run `npm install`
4. `cd` into the 'client' directory, and also run `npm install`, then run `npm start` to compile the Typescript and open the client app in the browser. (If you just want to work on the client side code, you can make changes in this state, and they'll update in the browser.)
5. `cd` into the root of the directory again, begin a database instance by running `mongod` in the terminal, in another tab, then run `npm start` or `nodemon` and navigate to localhost:8080 in the browser
